# Installation via precompiled binaries
Download the binaries either from the [release page](https://github.com/legendofmaj/anijouhou/releases) or to get the latest development version from [GitHub actions](https://github.com/legendofmaj/anijouhou/actions).

In order to launch anijouhou from your terminal emulator you will need to copy the binary to a directory in your path. If you don't need that, you can skip the following steps.
## On Linux
```bash
sudo cp anijouhou /usr/bin/
```
## On Windows
- make sure a bin directory is present e.g.: `C:\Users\YourUsername\bin\` (If not, create one)
- move `anijouhou.exe` to the directory
- add your bin directory to PATH:
  - open settings
  - search for path and choose `edit the system environment variables`
  - click on `environment variables`
  - choose `path` and click `edit`
  - choose `new` and add your bin directory
  - click ok to all the close dialogues
- launch the app with `anijouhou` in any terminal
